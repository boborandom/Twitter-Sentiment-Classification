## Tweet Classification Application

## Project Description
The team was tasked with modelling an application to classify tweet messages into four sentiment classes, aimed at understanding peopleâ€™s views on climate change to assist companies in improving marketing strategies. The application utilises machine learning classification algorithms to classify text inputted into it into the following sentiments: Pro, Anti, Neutral, and News.

- News (2): Tweets that link to factual news about climate change.
- Pro (1): Tweets that support the belief in man-made climate change.
- Neutral (0): Tweets that neither support nor refute the belief in man-made climate change.
- Anti (-1): Tweets that do not believe in man-made climate change.

The application provides users with options to utilize any of the following classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-nearest neighbor, and Linear SVC. Each algorithm is described and explained on how it works.

The application displays the data used to train the model and offers the option to view the raw data. For interested users, there is a tab for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) where insights found in the data are shown.
